'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (レオン ''Leon'') is a [[:Category:Bachelors (RF4)|bachelor]] in ''[[Rune Factory 4]]''.

He's the second bachelor to have a monster form, which the protagonist must defeat in order to date him and to continue on with the game's plot. Leon's monster form originally hailed from the tower-like temple dungeon known as Leon Karnak, which is situated far West from where Selphia is.

==Profile==
===Personality===
A man once sealed in Leon Karnak. Easygoing and loves messing with people, but works hard and secretly helps them out however he can. Has a charismatic aura that causes others to naturally look up to him.

He is light-hearted and prone to making fun of serious people.

===Appearance===
Leon possesses traits of his monster form compared to any other guardians. He has fox ears, a fox tail, and runic patterns etching his face.

==Story==
Leon was born hundreds of years before the main plot into an unnamed family. He was childhood friends with a girl named Maria, and even agreed to marry her eventually. At some point, he became a dragon priest and would often listen to people's problems. Before becoming a guardian, Leon was a dragon priest to [[Ventuswill]]. When traversing the Forest of Beginnings at Leon Karnak, it is revealed that Leon chose to sacrifice himself both for his duties and to save Ventuswill as a friend.

He decided to become a Guardian and was sent off by his friends and family. His body was fused with the earth's runes to keep sending power to [[Ventuswill]], making him the first guardian. He slept for hundreds of years until being awoken by either [[Lest and Frey|Lest or Frey]].

Leon is awoken after the protagonist defeats [[Sarcophagus]]. He is brought back to town to recover and reunite with [[Ventuswill]]. After being brought to town, Leon moves in with [[Xiao Pai]] and [[Lin Fa]]. Although Leon finds the antics of both the mother and the daughter amusing and quickly takes to teasing them, he becomes fairly close to them. However, he sees them more as friends than as family members. Leon can also be seen fishing during most mornings near the pond in Selphia's residential area.

===A Day In Leon's Life===
[[File:Rune Factory 4 Leon Town Event - A Day In Leon's Life|thumb]]'''A Day In Leon's Life''' () is Leon's town event. Leon can be found speaking with [[Vishnal]]. They discuss a book and Vishnal sugghests that he speak with [[Kiel]], as he is more knowledgeable than he seems.

Leon can upgrade spells for you once he has been rescued. It should be noted that musical spells (that allow your party members to perform at higher levels) and weapon skills (that allow you to perform a special move based on your current weapon) will BE ACCEPTED AS A GIFT, as Leon cannot upgrade those. Also, you must have the item in your bag for him to upgrade the spell - this is not treated as a quest, but more of an exchange where the upgrade is performed on the spot or not at all. The costs for upgrading spells to each level are as follows (with the base as level 1).

==Trivia==
*Leon is the oldest bachelor in ''Rune Factory 4''.
*Leon shares the same birthday as [[Mana]] from ''[[Rune Factory 2: A Fantasy Harvest Moon|Rune Factory 2]]''.
*Leon has the same voice actor as [[James]] from Rune ''[[Rune Factory: Tides of Destiny]]''.
*During the Buddy Battle, Leon's team is the strongest the protagonist faces.
*Leon will upgrade magic scrolls for money, gems and rare items, depending on the level of the scroll. However, he will not upgrade rune abilities.
*The two foxes with Leon at Leon Karnak are named '''Uno''' and '''Sano.'''
* His Full name is '''Leon Bastet VIII''' it was reviled in Rune Factory 4's Official Comic in Nintendo Dream
* Of all the bachelors and bachelorettes, Leon is the only one not to be listed in the instructions booklet that comes with the game on the heroes/heroines pages. This is likely just an oversight, seeing how the spacing of the bios for each bachelor and bachelorette would have required Leon to be on a completely new page.
* Nicknames the female protagonist can call him after the confession event are Darling, Leo, Mr. Leon, Leo-Leo and Sir Leon. Nicknames he offers to call you are Love, You, Li'l <Name>, My Lady and Princess <Name>.
