'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (ビシュナル, ''Viznar'') is a [[:Category:Bachelors (RF4)|bachelor]] in ''[[Rune Factory 4]]''.

==Profile==
===Personality===
Vishnal is a very open and optimistic young man. He acts friendly to everyone he meets and is the first to offer help should they need it. The downside to this is that he often interprets a person's words at face value, so he's easily fooled. [[Bado]] especially takes advantage of his naivety and tries to push useless items on him by saying they will help make him a great butler.

Seeing how he wants to become a world-famous butler, Vishnal is always polite to those around him, like he is serving them. For example, after it has been revealed that the player are not the royal family member the town was expecting, he will be the only person who keeps referring to Lest/Frey as Prince/Princess to better help him role-play as a royal butler.

Although he tries his best at everything, Vishnal doesn't always have much success. Notably, he's a horrible cook. He still gives it his all and, as someone who wears his heart on his sleeves, it's pretty easy to tell whether he's feeling confident or not about the work he's done so far.

===Appearance===
Vishnal has dark skin, but colored as tan in game.

On his left arm he has a crown (in his case, an armlet) very similar to [[Volkanon]]'s, except in a different color and smaller.

==Story==
The son of a doctor, he was raised to pursue a career where he could help others. Since he believed he wasn't smart enough to be a doctor, he searched for other careers until he eventually met a skilled butler that inspired his dream to became the greatest of butlers. He then left home for [[Selphia]] and is now learning the trade from [[Volkanon]], who is his superior.

Vishnal will be the tutorial giver at the beginning, teaching the player how to properly farm.

==Events==
===Date===
Nicknames the female protagonist can call him after the confession event are Darling, Mr. Vishnal, Sir Vishnal and Vin, and Sweetie. Nicknames he offers to call her are Honey, Master, Li'l and Princess.

If the female protagonist asks Vishnal on a date to Selphia: Dragon Lake, he will admit to her that he can't swim.

==Requests==
Requests have been removed in ''Rune Factory 4''.

==Relationships==
If Frey chooses Vishnal to be one of her lovers, she will ask him when he started liking her. Vishnal will admit that he had a crush on her when they first met. [[Doug]] is another bachelor who will admit this.

==Trivia==
*According to Namikawa Daisuke (Vishnal's Japanese VA) at the official site, Vishnal is 183 cm tall or 6' tall. He's also supposedly much younger in age than how he appears to be.<ref>[http://www.fogu.com/hmforum/viewtopic.phpf=15&t=150198&hilit=dylas&start=4080#p4965573]</ref>
*Vishnal's battle cry, "Butler Power", has some allusions with Hayate's role in the anime series "''Hayate the Combat Butler''".
*Vishnal shares the same birthday with [[Eunice]] from ''[[Rune Factory: Frontier]]''.
