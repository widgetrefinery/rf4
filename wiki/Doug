'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (ダグ, ''Dag'') is a [[:Category:Bachelors (RF4)|bachelor]] in ''[[Rune Factory 4]]''.

==Profile==
Doug was a dwarf who had shown up in town one day and now lives with [[Blossom]]. He helps her run the general store on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Although he often complains about how boring the work is and even falls asleep on the job, Doug loves being able to help Blossom, not that he'd ever admit it. He has his reputation and image to protect and if people found out that he's got a sweet side when it comes to his mother figure then it would ruin everything. Despite going to great lengths to hide and deny it, Doug cares deeply for Blossom and constantly worries about her health. Doug's fretting, and the rash actions he takes to help Blossom from time to time, in turn, make her worry about him.

===Personality===
Doug loves anything that keeps him active or involves food, but has a short attention span for most other activities. Festivals like the Buddy Battle or the Eating Contest excite him, but Fishing Tournaments or Crop Festivals don't interest him much. Although Doug loves to eat, and can ingest unhealthy amounts of rice, he's not overly skilled at cooking. On White Day, Doug will even mention that he baked so many cookies that didn't turn out right.

He has a bit of an ego, and likes to think of himself as tough. Doug enjoys training and can be boastful at times, but is quick to agree that he's not the strongest person in town.

Despite being a dwarf, Doug isn't good at any sort of crafting activity. Doug's clan died before anyone could train him, and he's self-depreciating about his lack of skill when it comes to making accessories or weapons.

===Appearance===
[[Zaid|Zaid]]'s tribe was also killed off by humans, hinting that Doug and Zaid are from the same tribe, that and the fact that they both have silver eyes which all of those in Zaid's tribe had.

==Story==
In the first arc of the story, Doug is at odds with Frey/Lest, trying to stop them from gathering the Rune Spheres. After his motives are thrown into question, he steps back and puts his trust in them. In the second arc, Doug exposes information about the Sechs and gets injured.

==Main Sub-Event==
===Story===
Upon exiting Selphia, Lest/Frey will hear Forte scream and come back inside. Forte and Doug are dealing with a soldier from the Sechs Empire who tries to convince Doug to assist him in defeating Forte but to no avail. The soldier goes on to tell Forte about how Doug was a spy brought in from the Sechs Empire. Suddenly, Blossom appears and tells the soldier to back off, saying that Doug is a kind person who always helps at her shop and that the accusations of him being a spy are just a ruse to turn the citizens against each other. 

Tired of Blossom's tirade, the soldier attempts to silence her for good, only for Doug to step in the way of the attack meant for Blossom. A wounded Doug asks if Blossom's alright as Lest/Frey appear to assist the group. Then, the soldier looks to Lest/Frey and recognizes them from the beginning of the game, stating that their captain is already long gone and expressing their surprise at Lest/Frey surviving their fall. They go on about the '''Rune Sphere''' until Doug gets back on his feet to battle the soldier once more. 

The soldier, surprised at Doug's commitment to Selphia wonders aloud if Doug has realized that the Sechs Empire was responsible for the death of his tribe and not Ventuswill. Everyone exclaims shock at the soldier's statement, with Doug surprised at the remark. The soldier reasons that it would be the only thing that could make Doug betray their cause, with Doug reiterating his surprise once more and the soldier responding back that it was the Sechs Empire that killed his parents. Doug asks the soldier as to why the Sechs Empire would resort to that action with the soldier non-chalantly responding that it must have been because they disobeyed the Empire's orders or something.

Assuming a battle stance, the soldier tells Doug that he'll meet his parents soon, until Lest/Frey intervenes. The soldier gleefully exclaims that it's a perfect situation since they were tasked with the mission of eliminating the Earthmates. Forte steps in to defend Lest/Frey from the soldier's threats, displaying her battle prowess openly to the confident soldier. Suddenly, he reveals to everyone that he has the power of a rune sphere, revealing that the Sechs Empire has stolen all the Rune Spheres that were placed by Lest/Frey earlier in the game. He cruelly goes on about Ventuswill and how her condition must be deteriorating due to the stolen Rune Spheres. 

After the citizens of Selphia exclaim concern for Venti, the soldier harnesses the power of the Rune Spheres and uses the Omni Gate to summon a powerful dragon, merging himself with it by using the Etherlink ability. Bewildered by the sight, Forte steps back aghast while Lest wonders how the soldier could use the Omni Gate if only Earthmates had the ability to use it. Lest/Frey tells Blossom to take the wounded Doug somewhere safe while the Soldier becomes more deranged following his merger with the dragon. Forte assesses the danger in fighting the monster, telling Lest that they will fight together to prevent the soldier from harming anyone or anything from the town.

Following the soldier's defeat, he runs away from Selphia while Doug and Blossom approach Lest/Frey. Doug apologizes to Lest/Frey for accusing Ventuswill of the Sech Empire's crimes, with a wounded Doug expressing remorse for his earlier intentions towards the dragon. Blossom takes the wounded Doug to the clinic, expressing a desire to apologize to her and Ventuswill. Forte tells Lest/Frey that she will consult with Volkanon about Doug's status as a spy, expressing that she still trusts him because he wanted to save the town.

Lest/Frey visits a deteriorated Ventuswill who wonders about the commotion outside. After learning about how the Sechs Empire is planning to use the Rune Spheres for nefarious deeds, Ventuswill expresses her concern at the idea, stating that Rune Spheres possess powers of great magnitude, even capable of restoring her abilities as a native dragon. After Lest/Frey tells Ventuswill that they plan on getting back the Rune Spheres, Ventuswill comments on how strong of an individual they are, telling them to come back safely while she rests to conserve her energy. Lest/Frey decides to visit Doug at the clinic to gain information about the Sechs Empire.

===Marriage===
To see Doug's marriage sub-event, A Very Special Ring, his LP must be raised to at least 10 and the player has seen the random event Shining Memory and Doug's Secret. When it triggers, Doug will mention his late father, who was unable to teach Doug something before he died. Doug will then ask Frey out on a date and start fishing for information on how she wants to be proposed to. Over the next few days, Doug will be found asking the bachelors for advice on confessing, research help, and will practice confessing his love to Dylas. Shortly after, he will lock himself in Bado's forge and ask Frey to wait and not ask any questions.

After Frey recruits the bachelorettes to investigate, they come back with the finding that Doug looked into his clan's traditions, and has the materials for making an engagement ring. When Frey and the girls attempt to confront Doug, he gives a ring to everyone but Frey, and is chased of by Margaret for hurting her feelings. Doug comes to see Frey later and asks to please forgive him and wait a little longer, and shortly after the bachelors will come to Frey and clear up the confusion. Doug's clan has a tradition of giving a ring to everyone in the family of whoever they are proposing to. Since Doug cannot forge well, he was making Frey's ring last in the hopes that it would turn out best.

After the confusion is cleared, Frey goes to see Doug, who climbs onto the roof of his house and shouts out that he loves her, and asks for her hand in marriage.

===The Together Trio===
[[File:Rune Factory 4- Get It Together! Event|thumb]][[Clorica]], [[Amber]] and [[Doug]] created a group called "The Together Trio". They started a course called "Get it Together Course." Doug joined in the group because "a girl(Clorica/Amber) asked him to hang out". They wanted to do something else as their daily routine, or become more active. On the first day, they went to meet their first expert, 'Expert [[Forte]]'. She joins them for exercise, as "a disciplined mind, means a disciplined body". She later lead them on a "light jogging", they met at the plaza, then had some "sparring practice".

The next day, the three of them went to meet 'Expert [[Arthur]]'. Upon hearing their 'course', Arthur offered them to help with his work. Doug didn't really want to, but he agreed to help afterwards. Arthur then gave them the paperwork, he asked them to stamp the forms and told them that the paperwork was not the most difficult job, but it is nonetheless important. After a few minutes, Doug was bored, so he went outside, bringing much to Lest/Frey's doubt of their 'help' to Arthur. Arthur, being an optimist, believed that they were doing their best in their own way. After done 'helping', Clorica thanked Arthur for teaching them, Arthur thanked them back for helping with his work instead. They went out not a moment after. They promised to meet again tomorrow. Clorica was having fun working, even though Doug thinks they should really do something other than 'work', Amber was just happy to be a part of the group.

The next, the trio went to see [[Margaret]], calling her 'Expert Meg'. Margaret had heard about them studying on how 'to get it together', she decided to teach them something that will help them foster their sense of rhythm. At first, they didn't understand it, Margaret then explain that rhythm isn't just important in music, but in everyday life. She tells them that keeping a rhythm in performing their daily activities regularly such as "sleeping regularly" and "eating three square meals a day". She believed that by setting and keeping up a proper daily rhythm will help them keep it together. She began the lesson by starting the music, she then starts teaching them how to keep in rhythm by having them keep up with her dance moves. Doug was a bit sloppy, but he still tries to keep up. On the second 'phrase', Doug fell, and didn't seem wanted to rise up. After the lesson, he felt dizzy, and wasn't sure he can dance some more. The three of them had a small meeting afterwards. Clorica said that the next lesson will be the last, Doug didn't really understand the lesson, but was a bit sad that the lessons were almost over.

On the following day, they went to see 'Expert [[Dolce]]'. Dolce said that she doesn't have anything to teach them. But after Clorica, Amber and Doug persuade her, Dolce agreed after being called a 'Teacher'. She began teaching them to keep it together by always keeping calm under any cicumstances. Suddenly, [[Pico]] came rushing to hug Dolce, but Dolce dodged and Pico accidentally fell into the river. Then, Dolce wanted them to try keeping calm, but Doug was not sure how to. Clorica sees [[Vishnal]] just walking by the street, and called him to join them. Dolce wanted Vishnal to be their 'practice opponent', Vishnal asked what kind of practice opponent it was, Dolce replied by saying to let the three of them just beat him up. The three of them had beaten him up, leaving Vishnal all bruised up. Dolce said that the lesson is over, then she brings Vishnal over to the clinic. Clorica announced that their "Get It Together Course" has already finished. Doug was happy that the course is finished, Amber was also happy that they all worked hard. Doug asked Clorica why she just give away a 'lukewarm' reaction. Clorica still wasn't sure if she really can keep it together. Doug and Amber tells her that she had more of it together than both of them. Clorica is grateful that she improved. She said that "The Together Trio" finally had to break-up, but she is sure that their experience together will last forever.

==Relationships==
Before coming to [[Selphia]], Doug lived with his father and clan somewhere in or near the Sechs Empire. One day he happened to leave on his town and returned to find that his whole clan had been killed. Distraught, he agreed to help the Sechs spy on Selphia after being told that the one responsible for his clan's death was [[Ventuswill]], who lived in that town. When he first arrived, he never smiled and rarely spoke. Nowadays, some people feel as though he talks too much.

Although Doug was sullen when he first came to Selphia, he warmed up to the citizens by the time Lest/Frey arrived in town. Doug is friends with [[Vishnal]] and [[Kiel]] and from time to time, he can be found hanging out with the two in Kiel's house. Doug likes to tease the two, but is just as likely to be subject to their light jests. However, he harbors a secret that prevents him from fully opening up to the town, which is closely linked to the plot. For this reason, Doug's FP or LP will not rise above 3 until the second part of the plot has been completed.

Doug doesn't seem to get along with [[Dylas]]. The two are near incapable of being in the same room without arguing. Even when forced to see things from the other's perspective and trying to apologize for a previous fight, the two still end up yelling at one another. However, many of the townsfolk suspect they care about one another quite a bit, and the two have been known to show small, friendly gestures, such as secretly giving one another birthday gifts, or showing concern when the other is in danger. When the player enters water ruins, Doug saves the player from a monster. He mentions Dylas meaning, Doug and Dylas are both around the same age. He is still called "shrimp" and "midget" by Dylas.
