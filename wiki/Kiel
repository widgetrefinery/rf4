'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (キール ''Keel'') is a [[:Category:Bachelors (RF4)|bachelor]] in ''[[Rune Factory 4]]''.

==Profile==
===Personality===
Despite looking rather young, Kiel is an extremely smart and studious person. He spends most of his time studying in hopes of one day becoming an asset for the town. As such, he is one of the most well-read people in town and others often go to him for information. Due to his study habits, he is a huge fan of books. His room has a couple bookshelves, all crammed with books, and he even gives the protagonist a bookshelf for free. In his spare time, Kiel either reads for fun or shares stories he found with his friends. His love of reading is so great that the other townsfolk point to him when someone is searching for a book, instead of someone like Arthur who works in trade.

Kiel is kind and open with everyone he meets, always offering to help in anyway he can. Even when given his most hated gift, he is polite and explains what he likes with a smile on his face. Thanks to this, he is well-liked by everyone and it is near impossible to see him be rude or angry. Though, behind this kindness is a rather low sense of self-worth. He tries not to let it show very often, but Kiel does not think highly of himself and is rather shocked if anyone does (such as when given his favorite gifts, thinking they can't be for him, or if the player attempts to date him).

A notable trait he possesses is his tendency to spread rumors no matter how absurd they might be, something his sister is quick to chide him for. Nonetheless, he loves listening to and telling others about any rumors he overhears. This isn't to say he can't doubt or is too gullible, despite what Bado and Forte think. In fact, there are times when he'll tell the protagonist about a rumor he learned and then laugh about how he doesn't believe it at all. It seems less that he believes all the rumors he hears and more that he enjoys telling people everything he hears, whether he believes it or not. Kiel is also well aware of the fact that he is spreading rumors with no evidence to support them, but he equates it to simply "chatting" with his friends as usual.

Another trait he has that goes hand in hand with spreading rumors is his inability to keep a secret. It is a known fact in Selphia that one does not tell Kiel something they are uncomfortable with the whole town knowing by sun down. However, he's not malicious about this and even shows regret when he realizes everyone knows the secret he tried to keep; it's more that he gets carried away when he talks. He'll admit that while he wants to keep others' secrets, not telling his friends everything he knows feels wrong to him, as if he's lying. He does occasionally catch and stop himself from spilling a secret, and some events reveal that, if it's important enough, he is more than capable of keeping a secret to himself, even from his own sister.

===Appearance===
Kiel has blonde hair and blue eyes.

==Story==
He is [[Forte]]'s younger brother. Kiel is a young man who is very fond of books. All he wants is to be needed, which is why he studies so much, even at his age. Even though he is very intelligent, he is also very naive. He can be talkative, honest, and kind to a fault. He is often prone to spreading the word of anything he hears even if they are just rumors.

In [[Selphia]], he is the person the townsfolk usually go to when they need information about the land, Native Dragons, and more. He shares this "job" with [[Arthur]], who is also known to go to Kiel when he is in need of information due to how well-read he is.

===Event===
{{Main|Town Events (RF4)}}

==Requests==
Requests have been removed in ''Rune Factory 4''.

==Relationships==
Kiel gets along with everyone in town and is close friends with all the bachelors, especially [[Leon]], whom he admires and tries to emulate, much to his sister's frustration. Arthur often comes to him for his knowledge and several events show them helping advance the plot with information they found. [[Vishnal]] occasionally asks for advice about cooking from Kiel and the two often hang out in Kiel's room along with [[Doug]]. And while they are not seen together often, Kiel is also good friends with [[Dylas]], being the first person to realize that his gruff attitude is actually a mask for how shy he is.

Kiel also has a special relationship with Bado, being something of a god son to him. Bado was close friends with Kiel and Forte's father, so he tries to look out for the two, but neither really view him as a mature, parental figure. In fact, Kiel often mentions doing chores for Bado since he can barely keep his business running.

==Schedule==
Kiel lives in the housing district, next to [[Bado]]'s blacksmith shop, with his older sister Forte. He spends a lot of his time at home cooking and cleaning, since she is incapable of doing either of these tasks without causing disaster. Despite this, Kiel shows no signs of resentment and is always happy to cook for his sister and his friends. When he is not cooking or cleaning, he often studies in his room or hangs out with the other bachelors.
