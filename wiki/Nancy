'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (ナンシー, ''Nanshii'') is a [[:Category:Characters (RF4)|character]] in ''[[Rune Factory 4]]''.
==Profile==
===Personality===
Wife of Dr. Jones and nurse at the local clinic. Loves her husband immensely and always strives to be the best wife she can be for him. Sweet, kind and always considerate of patients' feelings.
===Appearance===
Nancy has long blonde hair styled in low ponytail with her bangs parted, and blue eyes. She always wears a pink nurse cap and can't be seen without it.

==Story==
When Nancy was younger, she often found herself falling down and going to the clinic. She claims this was due to her becoming weak in the knees when seeing [[Jones]]. When she was young, she had many dreams, including getting married to someone she loved, becoming a nurse, and being a good mother. She took up nursing because she wanted to help [[Jones]] save people.

Nancy is a nurse and runs the Little Bandage clinic alongside her husband in order to help the people of Selphia. Forte was often brought to the clinic in the past.

==Relationships==
Nancy is [[Jones]]' wife. Her relationship with Jones can be a little too sweet to some and makes the older residents of town feel uncomfortable, though the bachelorettes have shown envy of their relationship. A few people in town (such as [[Blossom]] and [[Volkanon]]) comment on how their relationship is wonderful but their public displays of affection make them feel awkward or embarrassed.

Once Lest/Frey has unlocked [[Dolce]], she will live with Nancy and Jones. Nancy quickly grows to see Dolce as her beloved daughter.

Nancy also creates an anniversary for various things in her life, including a "Hero's Proof" anniversary and an anniversary for when they took in [[Dolce]]. Nancy talks about how she became a nurse in order to help people.

==Trivia==
*When Love Potion is given to Nancy, she will accept it. However Nancy will not show any sign of affection toward Lest/Frey, instead she will say:
**"Oh, I know what that is. It's Love Potion, isn't it?"
**"Of course I'm familiar with it. Why, when i was young, I..."
**"..."
**"Love is something that will make itself felt, without you needing to resort to potions, you know."
**"Good luck! Oh, and just to be clear, Jones is the only one for me."
*Implying that she was a victim or abuser of Love Potion when she was young.
