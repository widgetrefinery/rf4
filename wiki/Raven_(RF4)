'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (トウーナ, ''Toona'') is a [[:Category:Characters (RF4)|characters]] in ''[[Rune Factory 4]]''.

==Profile==
Raven came to Selphia to look for rare ores to bring back to Sharance. She sells mostly items that have already been shipped, which the player can use to synthesize items. Raven can be summoned to town everyday with the Prince/Princess Point system, if the player has enough Prince/Princess points.

===Personality===
Raven retains her personality, she becomes slightly more extroverted, able to talk with customers with more communication materials rather than just greeting and persuading. Her likes and dislikes become her default template, this goes the same with her weapon of choice.

===Appearance===
As a returning character from ''[[Rune Factory 3: A Fantasy Harvest Moon]]'', Raven keeps the same physical appearance like when she was in mentioned game.

==Story==
After [[Amber]], [[Dylas]], [[Dolce]], [[Pico]] and [[Leon]] tried to come up with an idea and way to bring Ventuswill back, Dolce came to Raven to buy some materials to make accessories. Dolce paid her extra, but the material's quality was excellent, Both of them had a talk about Families, Lest/Frey came to talk with Raven afterwards, talking about what matters in having a family, regardless even if the person is not family by blood. Raven then wishes Lest/Frey good luck.

==Relationships==
Raven will also accompany the player in dungeons once he/she has befriended her. Raven will also occasionally mention people and things from Sharance, mostly [[Gaius]].

Raven seems to have befriended Dolce. Both of them have a dealer-customer relation for Raven saying that '...She's a good customer'. Despite that, both of them had also talked about their families. Whether they actually had a real heart-to-heart talk is unclear because both of them constantly showing blank faces.

She will occasionally compare Lest and Frey's manners and speaking habits to Micah's.
