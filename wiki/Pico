}}'''Pico''' (ピコ, ''Piko'') is a character in ''[[Rune Factory 4]]''

==Profile==
===Personality===
A friendly ghost girl who is very fond of [[Dolce]]. She will draw you into Marionetta's dungeon when she first starts showing up around town.

===Appearance===
Pico has light skin and light purple hair worn in big pigtails held by red ribbons. Her green eyes have no pupil. She wears a light pink and purple jester cap with a cute face in the middle, as well as two yellow stars hanging from both horns.

==Story==
Although Pico is an individual character, she never appears unless the player approaches Dolce first.

Once Marionetta has been defeated, Pico and Dolce will live with [[Jones]] and [[Nancy]] in the Tiny Bandage Clinic.

==Events==
If the player befriends Dolce to 10 hearts/friendship points, he/she can make an order to let Pico wake him/her up.

==Relationships==
Pico adores Dolce and often says things that embarrasses her, as well as calling her "Dolly", her affectionate nickname. She seems to have an obsession with Dolce, possibly a crush as it's hinted through dialogue and her nickname from Dolce "Pervert". Since she is a ghost, she cannot go too far away from Dolce or her soul will pass on. Her being a ghost has had advantages as well, being the only constant friend [[Ventuswill]] had for centuries, even before [[Illuminata]]. Due to her need to stay near Dolce, Pico may be one of the oldest villagers in town.


==Nicknames==

*Little Pervert

*Good for Nothing Waste of Air
