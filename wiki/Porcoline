'''Porcoline Tulle De Saint-Coquille''' (ポコリーヌ, ''Pokoriinu'') is a [[:Category:Characters (RF4)|character]] in ''[[Rune Factory 4]]''.

==Profile==
===Personality===
Porcoline is a very skilled chef, but because he chows down while he cooks, his efficiency is amazingly low, no matter how many ingredients he has with him. He's a kind person who helps those in need.

===Appearance===
Despite being male, Porcoline has the appearance of a woman. He has pale skin with blue eyes and long peach hair, which is adorned by a white chef hat with feather. He is chubby.

==Story==
Oddly enough, he is proficient with dual blades, as his default weapon is two cooking ladles.

During one of the Doug's pajama parties, Dylas will mention that Porcoline once had an elven lover that died to sickness. It is implied to this pushed him to share his hospitality to great ends.
