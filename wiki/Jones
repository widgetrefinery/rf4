==Profile==
===Personality===

===Appearance===
Jones is a man with pale skin and turquoise eyes that he covers with a pair of glasses. His messy gray hair is worn with a brown laurel wrath. He wears a doctor's outfit.

==Story==
Jones mentions that he had a dream to be a farmer when he was a little boy but he was better suited to be a doctor.

==Events==

==Relationships==
He is [[Nancy]]'s husband, meaning they're the third couple in Rune Factory series (the first one being [[Sabrina]] and [[Neumann]] with [[Rita]] and [[Turner]] being the second one).

He and Nancy do not yet have any children; Nancy mentions that they haven't decided when to start a family yet. [[Dolce]] moves in with them after being freed by [[Lest and Frey|Lest/Frey]], becoming something of an adopted daughter to them.

Eastern Food="Oh, some [{{Blue|Item}}]. And I may have it? Why thank you. I {{Blue|like Eastern foods}} quite a bit. Dishes like {{Blue|sashimi}} are light and easy to eat."<br>"''Oh, is this for me? Thank you. Many {{Blue|Eastern foods}}, like fish, are full of healthy nutrients. Although I would still {{Blue|like}} them even if they were not.''"
|-|Flan="''Thank you. This looks like some very tasty [[Flan]]. Sweets are an effective pick-me-up when you are feeling mentally tired. That's an excuse I use often when I feel the urge to snack on some.''"<br>"''It isn't that I have a particular fondness for sweets. I {{Blue|like}} this dish specifically. You see, when I was little, [[Flan]] was a treat I could have only when I was sick. I guess that feeling must have simply stuck with me through the years.''"
|-|Moondrop="''Oh, thank you for the [{{Blue|Item}}]. I think I'll put it in the vase Dolce gave to me as a present. I'm sure Pico will love it. I can't wait to show it to her.''"
