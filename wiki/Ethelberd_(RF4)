==Profile==
===Personality===
Selfish Bastard by [[Lest and Frey]].

===Appearance===
Ethelberd is an old man with long white hair covering his left eye, matching his beard. Ethelberd's eyes are squinted and probably the same as his hair color. He wears a long dark blue robe adorned with two brown belts.

==Story==
Ethelberd has been bent on revenge against all Earthmates since his defeat by one in the past. His hatred extends to the point where Ethelberd has been systematically killing all Earthmates he has come across, basically the extermination of the Earthmate "species". While at first this was his intention with the protagonist as well, he quickly realized he could manipulate events to help him reach his final goals.

By using the rune spheres, he achieves the powers of an Earthmate. Using these powers, he steals Ventuswill's body to "become a god," losing his humanity in the process.

He is the final boss in the second arc of the game. This battle is located at the very end of the Floating Empire dungeon.

==Relationships==
Because Ethelberd is not from human world, he has not known relationships.
