'''{{PAGENAME}}''' (マーガレット ''Marguerite'') or also known by her nickname, '''Meg''', is one of the bachelorettes in ''[[Rune Factory 4]]''.

Margaret has acrophobia, which means she is afraid of heights. Ironically, she lives in a house that is situated at the farthest edge of [[Selphia]]'s eastern district.

Magaret also gives a few hints when she compares herself to Frey that she (Frey) might be a little sensitive about her height.

==Profile==
===Personality===
Margaret is seen to be very kind and caring, though serious when it comes to the well-being of those she cares about. She is very peaceful, especially when it comes to music. Though talking about the subject can show a hyper, bubbly, and energetic side. She is a worrywart, always worrying about many things and sometimes confused due to worrying too much.

Despite Margaret's sisterly attitude towards other people, she possesses a hidden and frightened side to her personality. This has to do with the fact she is an elf and that while elves age slowly, it means that most of them end up outliving their human companions. This is partially brought up when Lest chooses to the confess to Margaret and the reasons behind her fears are further fleshed out during her main sub-event.

In some instances, Margaret can come off as hyper-active when it comes to topics of music, as she can go on a fanatical explanation on her favorite musicians if the player chooses to observe the paintings inside of her house.

===Appearance===
She and Illuminata are the only elves, while Doug and Bado are the only dwarves.

Notice in her pajamas, the flowers Margaret normally wears in her hair are actually pink instead of blue.

==Story==
As a musician, Margaret's specialties include being able to play instruments such as the harp, lute, and piano. Margaret is also a capable singer, as she can sometimes be heard singing when walking around town.

She initially left the Elven Kingdom in order to see the world. However, [[Porcoline|Porcoline De Saint-Coquille]], who was acting as an ambassador to the elves at the time, ran into her by chance. As he was soothed by her beautiful music and appearance, he eventually scouted her to be his cafe's main musician.

Various hints scattered in the game point to Margaret being [[Daria]]'s sister. These hints include to her "Bravo" battle cry, which parallels Daria's "Rainbow", Margaret's love for shrimp and how she thinks their tiny legs are cute (contrary to Daria, who finds them creepy) and [[Raven (RF4)|Raven]] mentioning in one dialogue that there is an elf in [[Selphia]] who she believes is very similar to Daria.

Furthermore, Margaret herself has mentioned having an older sister who she used to sing for all the time.<ref><blockquote><small>[http://fogu.com/hmforum/viewtopic.php?p=4869811#p4869811

==Events==
===Marriage Sub-Event===
[[File:29 5681.png|thumb]]
The event is first triggered when Everyone in the town is concerned due to the recent outbreak of sightings regarding a Siren. Both Lest and Margaret soon end up investigating the nearby lake in Selphia Plains. Eventually, Margaret begins distancing herself from Lest, forcing him to consult [[Porcoline]] on the matter. [[Porcoline]] states that when Margaret first arrived, she was accompanied by her mentor. The two shared a very close bond, but he passed away naturally due to him being very old at the time. [[Porcoline]] then confronts Margaret with the fact that she is struck with paranoia of losing Lest, and states that he's closer to her than her master. Margaret immediately runs off, forcing Lest to follow closely. When he arrives to her at the same lake, she is quickly ambushed by a Siren, who takes Margaret's voice.

Upon returning, Margaret loses her ability to talk and sing, forcing her to communicate with writing, while [[Porcoline]], [[Kiel]] and [[Jones]] search for a cure to Margaret's problem.

Later Blosssom tells Lest of an old story regarding a Siren. She stated that this Siren had attacked the village numerous times, but a traveler managed to convince it to stop attacking after numerous visits. He would continuously visit the Siren to listen to her song, and she began being called "Audy". However, when he died, no one heard of the Siren ever since. Kiel also reports of the same Siren, but is still curious to why Sirens would need to steal voices when their's would already be well-off.

Margaret soon opens up an old Melody Bottle that she, [[Illuminata]] and Lest had found before, and it soon reveals that the message was intended for the same Siren. Before leaving, Margaret forces herself to say that she had always been scared, but now, she has to overcome it in order to still be with Lest. Soon they confront the Siren with the message, and, as expected, the Siren is surprised about the message, and admits that she had fallen for the man, but began acting aggressively due to the fact that he never returned. She soon returns Margaret's voice to her, asking the elf to not follow the same path.

After Margaret's voice is returned to her, she jumps toward Lest and kisses him. They both return to the town square where she ask him for his ear and whispers that she will be expecting him to say an "important string of words" to her and that she will be waiting.

The event ends with [[Porcoline]] overjoyed with the return of Margaret's voice.

==Requests==
N/A

==Relationships==
[[Forte]]: Margaret is close friends with Forte, who she often teases into trying new things. Oddly enough, the pair are both afraid of heights.

Other bachelorettes: Margaret is also very maternal towards the rest of the bachelorettes and Frey. She can be seen as the voice of reason when it comes to dealing with either Dylas or Porcoline's antics.

[[Nancy]]: Similar to the other bachelorettes, Margaret looks up to Nancy for advice. In one of her lovers' dialogue, one of her inner thoughts reveals that she has sought tips from Nancy involving her relationship with Lest.

[[Porcoline]]: Margaret is often seen on several occasions worrying over Porcoline's health, as she has asked Lest to help lure him into the Little Bandage Clinic for his routine check-up. Although Porcoline isn't her biological father, she sees him as one and he is one of the few people in town besides Illuminata and Forte in whom she confides.

==Battle==
Her main magic ability is "Bravo" Notes. It's an ability with high INT and its attacks consist of her music notes hitting opponents.

And as the name and quotation suggests, she cries out "Bravo" in her musical note attacks, akin to Daria's "Beautiful Attack" and "Rainbow".
